# chat0r
Small GUI chat application using the sockets Java API. Message retrieval is implemented via HTTP.
 Was developed while visiting the lecture "Einf√ºhrung in Rechnernetze" at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). 
 Probably does not work anymore because the URL the chat relies on was provided by the institute which held the lecture.
